# PathFinder
Create a pathfinder program using Djikstra and Visibility Graph.

The project is to find the shortest path between two points on a map. The map can be duplicated. You can also see information such as the number of points and edges of the map, the number of visibility lines between the points, and the distance between the start and goal points.
